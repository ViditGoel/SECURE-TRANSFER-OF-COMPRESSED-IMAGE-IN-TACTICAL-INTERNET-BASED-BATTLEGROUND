Wars are not only won on the battleground but in technology aspects as well. The key element in war is stealth to minimize the causalities as much as possible likewise we need to provide encryption to the data that is being transferred to safeguard it from unauthorized people like hackers, terrorists etc. So by the means of Tactical internet communication in the military, security is being looked after. Our project is concerning the need of secure transfer of compressed image using a basic algorithm like Huffman codes and transfer of data will be done through the Transfer Control Protocol using socket programming
